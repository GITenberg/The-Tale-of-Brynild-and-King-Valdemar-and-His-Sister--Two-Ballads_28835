5</span>THE TALE OF BRYNILD</h2>
<p>Sivard he a colt has got,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The swiftest &rsquo;neath the sun;<br />
Proud Brynild from the Hill of Glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In open day he won.</p>
<p>Unto her did of knights and swains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very flower ride;<br />
Not one of them the maid to win<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could climb the mountain&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The hill it was both steep and smooth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon its lofty head<br />
Her sire had set her, knight nor swain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He swore with her should wed.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Soon to the Danish monarch&rsquo;s court<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A messenger repaired,<br />
To know if there was any one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To try the adventure dared.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas talked about, and Sivard then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His purpose soon made known;<br />
Said he: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try upon my colt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring Brynilda down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode away, the way was far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The path was of the worst;<br />
He saw the shining Glass Hill, where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maid her durance curs&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And he away proud Brynild bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor deemed the adventure hard;<br />
To bold Sir Nielus her he gave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To show him his regard.</p>
<p>Proud Brynild and proud Signelil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those maids of beauteous mien,<br />
Down to the river&rsquo;s side they went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their silken robes to clean.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, thou proud Brynild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What now I say to thee,<br />
Where didst thou get the bright gold ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I on thy finger see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get the bright gold ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which on my hand you see?<br />
That gave me Sivard Snareswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he betrothed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though young Sivard gave thee that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he his love declar&rsquo;d,<br />
He gives thee to Sir Nielus now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In proof of his regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner than did Brynild hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The haughty hearted may,<br />
Than to the chamber high she went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where sick of rage she lay.</p>
<p>It was the proud Brynild there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fell sick, and moaning lay;<br />
And her the proud Sir Nielus then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attended every day.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Now hark to me, thou Brynild fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind is ill at ease;<br />
Know&rsquo;st thou of any medicine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can cure thy sad disease?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there be aught this world within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can make thee cease to moan,<br />
That thou shalt have, e&rsquo;en if it cost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All, all the gold I own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of nought within this world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can do my sickness good,<br />
Except of Sivard Snareswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It be the hated blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is nothing in this world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which can assuage my pain,<br />
Except of Sivard Snareswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head I do obtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To draw of Sivard Snareswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood I have no might;<br />
His neck is hard as burnished steel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No sword thereon will bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;O hark, Sir Nielus, hark to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My well beloved lord,<br />
Borrow of him his Adelring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His famous trusty sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him thou needest it so oft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou dost wage a fight,<br />
But soon as &rsquo;tis within thy hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hew off his head outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the bold Sir Nielus then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His mantle puts he on;<br />
To Sivard, his companion true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the high hall he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, O Sivard Snareswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sword unto me lend,<br />
For I unto the field of fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full soon my course must bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trusty faulchion Adelring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll freely lend to thee;<br />
No man be sure shall thee o&rsquo;ercome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; However strong he be.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;My trusty faulchion Adelring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee I&rsquo;ll freely yield,<br />
But, oh! beware thee of the tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the hilt conceal&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware thee of those frightful tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They all are bloody red;<br />
If down thy fingers they should run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wert that moment dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstood the bold Sir Nielus then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drew out the sword amain;<br />
One blow and off the head is hewn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sivard Snareswayne.</p>
<p>Beneath his mantle then he takes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head, distilling blood,<br />
And hurrying to the chamber high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Brynilda stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the head, the bloody head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou didst so crave to gain;<br />
For thee I&rsquo;ve done a felon deed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which gives my heart such pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;O lay aside the bloody head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It fills my heart with fright;<br />
And come to me, my dearest lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the linen white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I crave thee, woman, not to think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I came for sport and play;<br />
Thou wast the wicked cause that I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From honour went astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the bold Sir Nielus then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His faulchion he drew out;<br />
It was the beauteous Brynild whom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He all to pieces smote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now have I slain my comrade dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eke my lovely may,<br />
Yet still I am resolved in mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A third, a third to slay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So then against the hard stone floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He placed the trusty glaive;<br />
To his heart&rsquo;s root the point in went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him his death wound gave.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&rsquo;Twere better that this maid had died<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within her mother&rsquo;s womb,<br />
Than that these princely men through her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To such an end should come.</p>
<p>Now will I rede, each honest man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well to deliberate ever;<br />
Unequalled woman&rsquo;s cunning is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though guiles of men be clever.</p>
<p>She laughs when &rsquo;tis her wish to laugh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weeps when she will weep;<br />
Whene&rsquo;er she wants thy heart to move<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair words on thee she&rsquo;ll heap.</p>
<p>Be she sick, or be she well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In woman ne&rsquo;er confide;<br />
In murder red, by woman led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands Sir Nielus dyed.</p>
<h2><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER</h2>
<p>See, see, with Queen Sophy sits Valdemar bold.<br />
About little Kirsten much parlance they hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hark, my good Lord! I have this to propose,<br />
That thou shalt give Kirsten to Buris for spouse.</p>
<p>A sister thou hast, I a brave brother own,<br />
A wedding we&rsquo;ll have ere this good year be
flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never shall happen, as long as I live,<br />
That I to a horse-thief my sister will give.</p>
<p>My sister&rsquo;s a princess so fair and so bright,<br />
But Buris is liker a groom than a knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Then pale as a corpse grew Sophia to see;<br />
&ldquo;My noble lord, wherefore despisest thou me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen struck with fury her hand on the board:<br />
&ldquo;Be sure that I vengeance will have for that
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Valdemar now to the war-field should wend,<br />
Behind stays Sir Buris the land to defend.</p>
<p>Forth, forth from the land the bold King his course bent,<br
/>
So many a beautiful knight with him went.</p>
<p>Him followed so many a chivalrous band;<br />
He disposed of his sister, the fair mirror&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>To a prince rich and fine and of valour approved,<br />
He gave little Kirsten, his sister beloved.</p>
<p>With Buris Sophia sits over the board,<br />
And much brooded she on King Valdemar&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Sir Buris, my brother, list thou to my say:<br />
Beguile the King&rsquo;s sister whilst he is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Buris he cast on his sister his eyes:<br />
&ldquo;O why my dear sister dost talk in this guise?</p>
<p>To do such an act I will never consent,<br />
To make her my wife is my wish and intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen with her hand struck the table with force:<br />
&ldquo;Just, just as I bid thee direct thou thy
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mantle of azure Sir Buris puts on,<br />
And unto the princess Sir Buris is gone.</p>
<p>With prayers late and early the maiden he tired,<br />
But could not obtain from her what he desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Buris, why seekest thou me to betray?<br />
To my brother for this thou must answer some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>With ghastly white cheek did Sir Buris depart,<br />
The maiden he loved from the depths of his heart.</p>
<p>Sir Buris flung on him his scarlet array,<br />
And unto Sophia with speed took his way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The princess so firm and determined I find,<br />
No knight in this world can e&rsquo;er conquer her
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty man, thou, to take love-work in hand,<br />
If the powerful Runes thou dost not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the paths of fidelity I will return,<br />
No wish do I feel your Rune-magic to learn.</p>
<p>King Valdemar left his domain to my care,<br />
Shall I in return his dear sister ensnare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will for thee the Rune-characters trace,<br />
And thou them shalt cast in convenient place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;Sir Buris has cast the Rune-letters, alas,<br />
On the bridge over which little Kirsten should pass.</p>
<p>Little Kirsten with anguish was filled, and with care,<br />
Must spite of herself to Sir Buris repair.</p>
<p>She knocked with her hand on the thick oaken door:<br />
&ldquo;Sir Buris, arise, let me into thy bower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstood then Sir Buris, in scarlet array&rsquo;d,<br />
And straight he admitted the beautiful maid.</p>
<p>The whole night she lay in Sir Buris&rsquo; embrace,<br />
All to her own sorrow and daily distress.</p>
<p>Now on towards summer and autumn it drew,<br />
So stout in the waist little Kirsten she grew.</p>
<p>Her true waiting maid little Kirsten address&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;To the chamber of stone now convey me in haste.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>And there unto me do thou bring the mid-wife<br />
But let not the Queen know thereof for thy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her little foot-swain little Kirsten did say:<br />
&ldquo;Fetch hither Sir Buris, withouten delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They met on the lofty hall&rsquo;s high balcony,<br />
Together discoursed they so sorrowfully.</p>
<p>They gave then each other a tender caress,<br />
And swooned to the earth from of grief the excess.</p>
<p>The year has revolved, and home now from the fray,<br />
King Valdemar cometh triumphant and gay.</p>
<p>In, in through the portal King Valdemar strode,<br />
Sophia received him in complaisant mode.</p>
<p>About and around him King Valdemar stared:<br />
&ldquo;Say! where is my sister, and how has she fared?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Then sly &rsquo;neath her scarlet laughed Sophy the
Queen:<br />
&ldquo;It is full three months now since thy sister I&rsquo;ve
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophia exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;She is not to be taught,<br />
My advice and monition she holdeth at naught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O why dost thou thus of my sister complain?<br />
In honour she liv&rsquo;d without ever a stain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chamber of stone she has long made her home,<br />
There she of a little child light has become.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the heart of the monarch was smitten with grief:<br />
&ldquo;To thy words, O Sophia, I yield no belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessed Lord&rsquo;s truth and no lie have I
told,<br />
She invited me e&rsquo;en her child-birth to behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To five of his good knights spake sternly the King:<br />
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Depart, and my sister straight home to me
bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knights rode away as King Valdemar said,<br />
Much rather, much rather, would they have been dead.</p>
<p>They struck on the door &rsquo;neath their mantle of skin:<br
/>
&ldquo;Sweet princess Kirstina, arise, let us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the chamber straight came the true serving lass:<br />
&ldquo;We crave thy leave into the chamber to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sirs, ye may enter as free as the morn,<br />
For nobody here any baby has borne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in sorrowful mood good Sir Peter replied:<br />
&ldquo;God grant that thy words I may see verified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise, little Kirsten, thyself quick array,<br />
For thou to thy brother this night must away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Array thyself quick, for in hurry we are,<br />
Thy brother the King has returned from the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Alack, I dare venture my gold coronet,<br />
That I shall my death by this night-journey get.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter now take, and in linen enfold,<br />
The face of her mother no more she&rsquo;ll behold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assist ye my daughter to Christentie&rsquo;s breast,<br
/>
I fear that her luck will not be of the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the name that ye give her be proud Ingerlill,<br />
My fortune intends for me nothing but ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Kirsten her faithful maid servant address&rsquo;d:<br
/>
&ldquo;Now fetch to me hither, I pray, my gilt chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chest she unlocked where lay stored all her gear,<br />
And distributed that midst her servants so dear.</p>
<p>And most to her maid she thought fit to award,<br />
For she was to be her child&rsquo;s teacher and guard.</p>
<p>The gold, the red gold, she has given her so free,<br />
That tender and kind to her child she might be.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Every lady can well imagine how fit<br />
At present I am on my courser to sit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And each man, I am sure, can imagine how ill<br />
A journey nocturnal agree with me will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the saddle they placed her, with hearts full of care,<br />
Glittered like the spun gold her beautiful hair.</p>
<p>And when they arrived at the lofty castelle,<br />
Down, down from her horse little Kirstenlill fell.</p>
<p>At the window the Queen stood and laughed with delight:<br />
&ldquo;Come hither and view of your sister the plight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To lift her from the ground little Knud was not slow:<br />
&ldquo;In the name of Lord Jesus the whole truth avow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They helped her the stairs of the hall to ascend:<br />
&ldquo;Now thee to the powerful Christ we commend.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>In the doorway she crossed herself thrice on the
breast:<br />
&ldquo;To Christ I commend me, the mighty and blest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in through the door little Kirsten she wends,<br />
And his white hand to her the bold monarch tends.</p>
<p>Then unto her brother she gives her fair hand:<br />
&ldquo; I joy much to see thee returned to the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much favour and friendship to her he display&rsquo;d<br />
And that Queen Sophia so furious made.</p>
<p>The king to the brim filled a beaker with wine:<br />
&ldquo;I beg of thee drink to me, dear sister mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, little Kirsten, what I to thee say,<br />
Thou shalt sing before me some pretty love-lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never in all my life learnt a love-lay,<br />
But I&rsquo;ll sing another as well as I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;O thou with thy dancing, and eke with thy
voice,<br />
The hearts of my guests shalt this evening rejoice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sing then a song little Kirsten began,<br />
To the tune danced so many a bold knightly man.</p>
<p>The King himself sprang &rsquo;mid the dancers&rsquo; gay
band,<br />
And his sister he took by the lilly-fair hand.</p>
<p>He out and in with her eagerly danced,<br />
But nothing amiss in her movements he glanced.</p>
<p>So often the King proved the voice of the maid,<br />
And still to her gait more attention he paid.</p>
<p>And the King measured her by the girdle with care,<br />
But still he of nothing amiss was aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Sophia, may thee shame and evil betide,<br />
My dear little Kirsten thou&rsquo;st foully belied.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;It is the Lord&rsquo;s truth that I&rsquo;ve
told, and no lie,<br />
She has brought forth a daughter in secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen has yet worse little Kirsten distrest,<br />
Her two lovely breasts she tore out from her vest.</p>
<p>And, craving her ruin, with hand resolute<br />
She pressed out the milk before Valdemar&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>She pressed out the milk &rsquo;fore the King on the floor:<br
/>
&ldquo;My King and my husband, canst doubt any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then black as the earth grew King Valdemar&rsquo;s face,<br />
And Kirstenlil swooned &rsquo;neath the load of disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to wed thee but full speedily,<br />
Now thou shalt this evening with agony die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a mighty lord I&rsquo;d resolv&rsquo;d thee to
espouse,<br />
Now this very night thy young life thou shalt lose.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;The death the most cruel and painful of all,<br
/>
This night thou shalt suffer in this very hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Kirsten she fell &rsquo;fore the King on her knee:<br
/>
&ldquo;Dear brother! I pray shew some pity to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy kneeling, O Kirsten, will profit thee nought,<br />
The basest and vilest of sins thou hast wrought.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis folly to hope I shall mercy display,<br />
Thou injured me hast in such infamous way.</p>
<p>I promised thy hand, for of this nought I knew,<br />
To the son of a king &rsquo;cross the Haf&rsquo;s water
blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the foot-swain who stood at his side:<br />
&ldquo; Fetch hither five horse-whips,&rdquo; King Valdemar
cried.</p>
<p>Little Kirsten she fell down upon her bare knee:<br />
&ldquo;Now mighty Lord God! look with mercy on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;For four whips or five whips thou needest not
send,<br />
One will be quite enough to bring me to my end.&rdquo;</p>

His bosom with sorrow was filled, and with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little worthy were I of the title of Queen,<br />
Were I to essay such a harlot to screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punish her so, though I love her full
dear,<br />
That all shall thereof with astonishment hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lashed her so long, and he lashed her so sore,<br />
That grovelling she lay in a stream of red gore.</p>
<p>She crept for defence &rsquo;neath Sophia&rsquo;s array,<br />
With her foot she with vehemence spurned her away.</p>

And all for the damsel so piteously cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a hard hearted wretch thou, O Sophy, must be,<br

<p>He caused her be buried with grandeur and state,<br />
All the days of his life the King sighed for her fate.</p>

A chamber which fire nor light shall illume.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
